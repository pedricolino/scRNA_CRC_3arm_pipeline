    "Single-cell RNA-seq datasets have two important properties that one should have in mind when performing an analysis.\n",
    "Firstly, scRNA-seq data is drop-out meaning that there is an excessive number of zeros in the data due to limiting mRNA.\n",
    "Secondly, the potential for correcting the data and performing quality control might be limited as the data may be confounded with biology.\n",
    "It is therefore crucial to select preprocessing methods that are suited to the underlying data without overcorrecting or removing biological effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of tools for the analysis of single-cell {term}`RNA`-sequencing data is evolving fast due to new sequencing technologies and a growing number of captured cells, measured genes and identified cell populations {cite}`qc:Zappia2021`.\n",
    "Many of these tools are dedicated to preprocessing which aims to address the following analysis steps: doublet detection, quality control, normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "The tools selected throughout this chapter can heavily affect downstream analysis and interpretation of the data.\n",
    "For example, if you filter out too many cells during quality control, you might lose rare cell subpopulations and miss insight into interesting cell biology.\n",
    "Whereas if you are too permissive, you might have a hard time annotating your cells if you did not exclude poor quality cells in your preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "Therefore, it is important to select tools that provide a best practice and that proved to outperform other tools with respect to downstream tasks.\n",
    "In many cases, you will still have to re-assess your preprocessing analysis and change, for example, the filtering strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point of this notebook is single-cell data that has been processed as previously described in the raw processing chapter.\n",
    "The data was aligned to obtain matrices of molecular counts, the so-called count matrices, or read counts (read matrices).\n",
    "The difference between count and read matrices depends on whether unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were included in the single-cell library construction protocol.\n",
    "Read and count matrices have the dimension number of barcodes x number of transcripts.\n",
    "It is important to note that the term \"barcode\" is used here instead of \"cell\" as a barcode might wrongly have tagged multiple cells (doublet) or might have not tagged any cell (empty droplet/well).\n",
    "We will elaborate more on this in the section \"Doublet detection\"."

    "## Filtering low quality cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in quality control is to remove low-quality cells from the dataset. When a cell has a low number of detected genes, a low count depth and a high fraction of mitochondrial counts it might have a broken membrane which can indicate a dying cell. As these cells are usually not the main target of our analysis and might distort our downstream analysis, we are removing them during quality control. For identifying them, we define cell quality control (QC) threshold. Cell QC is typically performed on the following three QC covariates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of counts per barcode (count depth)\n",
    "2. The number of genes per barcode\n",
    "3. The fraction of counts from mitochondrial genes per barcode\n",
    "\n",
    "In cell QC these covariates are filtered via thresholding as they might correspond to dying cells. As indicated, they might reflect cells with broken membranes whose cytoplasmic mRNA has leaked out and therefore only the mRNA in the mitochondria is still present. These cells might then show a low count depth, few detected genes and a high fraction of mitochondrial reads. It is, however, crucial to consider the three QC covariates jointly as otherwise it might lead to misinterpretation of cellular signals. Cells with a relatively high fraction of mitochondrial counts might for example be involved in respiratory processes and should not be filtered out. Whereas, cells with low or high counts might correspond to quiescent cell populations or cells larger in size. It is therefore preferred to consider multiple covariates when thresholding decisions on single covariates are made. In general, it is advised to exclude fewer cells and be as permissive as possible to avoid filtering out viable cell populations or small sub-populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "QC on only a few or small datasets is often performed in a manual fashion by looking at the distribution of different QC covariates and identifying outlier which will be filtered afterwards. However, as datasets grow in size this task is becoming more and more time-consuming and it might be worth considering automatic thresholding via MAD (median absolute deviations). The MAD is given by $MAD = median(|X_i - median(X)|)$ with $X_i$ being the respective QC metric of an observation and describes a robust statistic of the variability of the metric. Similar to {cite}`qc:germain_pipecomp_2020`, we mark cells as outliers if they differ by 5 MADs which is a relatively permissive filtering strategy. We want to highlight that it might be reasonable to re-assess the filtering after annotation of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "In QC, the first step is to calculate the QC covariates or metric. We compute these using the scanpy function `sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`, which can also calculate the proportions of counts for specific gene populations. We therefore define mitochondrial, ribosomal and hemoglobin genes. It is important to note that mitochondrial counts are annotated either with the prefix \"mt-\" or \"MT-'' depending on the species considered in the dataset. Mitochondrial counts are annotated with the prefix \"MT-\" for human datasets. For mouse datasets, the prefix is usually lower case, so \"mt-\".\n"

    "\n",
    "Doublets are defined as two cells that are sequenced under the same cellular barcode, for example, if they were captured in the same droplet. That's why we used the term \"barcode\" instead of \"cell\" until now. A doublet is called homotypic if it is formed by the same cell type (but from different individuals) and heterotypic otherwise. Homotypic doublets are not necessarily identifiable from count matrices and are often considered innocuous as they can be identified with cell hashing or SNPs. Hence, their identification is not the main goal of the doublet detection methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Doublets formed from different cell types or states are called heterotypic. Their identification is crucial as they are most likely misclassified and can lead to distorted downstream analysis steps. Hence, doublet detection and removal are typically initial preprocessing steps. Doublets can be either identified through their high number of reads and detected features, or with methods that create artificial doublets and compare these with the cells present in the dataset. Doublet detection methods are computationally efficient and there exist several software packages for this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "{cite}`xi_benchmarking_2021` benchmarked nine different doublet detection methods and assessed their performance with respect to computational efficiency and doublet detection accuracy. They additionally assessed scDblFinder in an addendum to their benchmark which achieved the highest doublet detection accuracy and a good computational efficiency and stability {cite}`Xi_2021_addendum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will showcase the scDblFinder R package. scDblFinder randomly selects two droplets and creates artificial doublets from those by averaging their gene expression profiles. The doublet score is then defined as the fraction of artificial doublets in the k-nearest neighbor graph of each droplet in the principal component space.\n",

Common doublet detection methods generate artificial doublets by randomly subsampling pairs of cells and averaging their gene expression profile to obtain doublet counts.
