    "To understand your data better and make use of existing knowledge, it is important to figure out the \"cellular identity\" of each of the cells in your data. The process of labeling groups of cells in your data based on known (or sometimes unknown) cellular phenotypes is called \"cell annotation\". Whereas there are many ways to annotate your cells (e.g. based on batch, disease, sex and more), in this notebook we will focus on the annotation of \"cell types\".<br>\n",
    "So what is a cell type? Biologists use the term cell type to denote a cellular phenotype that is robust across datasets, identifiable based on expression of specific markers (i.e. proteins or gene transcripts), and often linked to specific functions. For example, a plasma B cell is a type of white blood cell that secretes antibodies used to fight pathogens and it can be identified using specific markers. Knowing which cell types are in your sample is essential in understanding your data. For example, knowing that there are specific immune cell types in a tumor or unusual hematopoietic stem cells in your bone marrow sample can be a valuable insight into the disease you might be studying.<br>\n",
    "However, like with any categorization the size of categories and the borders drawn between them are partly subjective and can change over time, e.g. because new technologies allow for a higher resolution view of cells, or because specific \"sub-phenotypes\" that were not considered biologically meaningful are found to have important biological implications (see e.g. {cite}`anno:KadurLakshminarasimhaMurthy2022`). Cell types are therefore often further classified into \"subtypes\" or \"cell states\" (e.g. activated versus resting) and some researchers use the term \"cell identity\" to avoid this sometimes arbitrary distinction of cell types, cell subtypes and cell states. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, we recommend the review by Wagner et al. {cite}`anno:Wagner2016` and the recently published review by Zeng {cite}`anno:ZENG20222739`.<br>\n",
    "Similarly, multiple cell types can be part of a single continuum, where one cell type might transition or differentiate into another. For example, in hematopoiesis cells differentiate from a stem cell into a specific immune cell type. Although hard borders between early and late stages of this differentiation are often drawn, the state of these cells can more accurately be described by the differentiation coordinate between the less and more differentiated cellular phenotypes. We will discuss differentiation and cellular trajectories in subsequent chapters.<br>\n",
    "So how do we go about annotating cells in single-cell data? There are multiple ways to do it and we will give an overview of different approaches below. As we are working with transcriptomic data, each of these methods is ultimately based on the expression of specific genes or gene sets, or general transcriptomic similarity between cells. "

    "The classical or oldest way to perform cell type annotation is based on a single or small set of marker genes known to be associated with a particular cell type. This approach dates back to \"pre-scRNA-seq times\", when single cell data was low dimensional (e.g. FACS data with gene panels consisting of no more than 30-40 genes). It is a fast and transparent way to annotate your data. However, when no unique markers exist for a specific cell type (which is often the case) this approach can get more complicated and even less objective, with combinations of markers or expression thresholds necessary for proper annotation. A robust set of marker genes and prior knowledge or annotation experience can help here, but the approach comes with the risk of unclear and subjective decision-making. "

    "In this setting, the data is often clustered before annotation, so that we can annotate groups of cells instead of making a per-cell call. This is not only less laborious, but also more robust to noise: a single cell might not have a count for a specific marker even if it was expressed in that cell, simply due to the inherent sparsity of single cell data. Clustering enables the detection of cells highly similar in overall gene expression and can therefore account for drop-outs at single cell level. "

    "Finally, there are two angles from which to approach the marker-gene based annotation. One option is to work from a table of marker genes for all the cell types you expect in your data and check in which those clusters are expressed. The other option is to check which genes are highly expressed in the clusters you defined and then check if they are associated with known cell types or states. If necessary, one can move back and forth between those approaches. We will show examples of both below."

    "Let's get started with the known-marker based approach. We will first list a set of markers for cell types in the bone marrow here that is based on literature: previous papers that study specific cell types and subtypes and report marker genes for those cell types. Note that markers at the protein level (e.g. used for FACS) sometimes do not work as well in transcriptomic data, hence using markers from RNA-based papers is often more likely to work. Moreover, sometimes markers in one dataset do not turn out to work as well in other datasets. Ideally a marker set is therefore validated across multiple datasets. Finally, it is often useful to work together with experts: as a bioinformatician, try to team up with a biologist who has more extensive knowledge of the tissue, the biology, the expected cell types and markers etc."

Unlike the method showcased above, each of these methods enables you to annotate your data in an automated way. They are based on different principles, sometimes requiring pre-defined sets of markers, other times trained on pre-existing full scRNA-seq datasets. As discussed below, the resulting annotations can be of varying quality. It is therefore important to regard these methods as a starting point rather than an end-point of the annotation process. See also several reviews {cite}`anno:PASQUINI2021961`, {cite}`anno:Abdelaal2019` for a more elaborate discussion of automated annotation methods."

    "As said, the quality of automatically generated annotations can vary. More specifically, the quality of the annotations depends on:\n",
    "1) The type of classifier chosen: Previous benchmark studies have shown that different types of classifiers often perform comparably, with neural network-based methods generally not outperforming general-purpose models such as support vector machines or linear regression models{cite}`anno:Abdelaal2019`, {cite}`anno:PASQUINI2021961`, {cite}`anno:Huang2021`.<br>\n",
    "2) The quality of the data that the classifier was trained on. If the training data was not well annotated or annotated at low resolution, the classifier will do the same. Similarly, if the training data and/or its annotation was noisy, the classifier might not perform well.<br>\n",
    "3) The similarity of your own data to the data that the classifier was trained on. For example, if the classifier was trained on a drop-seq single cell dataset and your data is 10X single nucleus rather than single cell drop-seq, this might worsen the quality of the annotation. Classifiers trained on cross-dataset atlases including a diversity of datasets might give more robust and better quality annotations than classifiers trained on a single dataset. An example is the CellTypist (an automated annotation method that will be discussed more extensively below) classifier trained on the Human Lung Cell Atlas {cite}`anno:Sikkema2023` which includes 14 different lung datasets. This model is likely to perform better on new lung data than a model that was trained on a single lung dataset.  "

    "The aforementioned points highlight possible disadvantages of using classifiers, depending on the training data and model type. Nonetheless, there are several important advantages of using pre-trained classifiers to annotate your data. First, it is a fast and easy way to annotate your data. The annotation does not require the downloading nor preprocessing of the training data and sometimes merely involves the upload of your data to an online webpage. Second, these methods don't rely on a partitioning of your data into clusters, as the manual annotation does. Third, pre-trained classifiers enable you to directly leverage the knowledge and information from previous studies, such as a high quality annotation. And finally, using such classifiers can help with harmonizing cell-type definitions across a field, thereby clearing the path towards a field-wide consensus on these definitions. "

Examples of such methods are Garnett {cite}`anno:Pliner2019` and CellAssign {cite}`anno:Zhang2019`. The more robust and generalizable the set of marker genes these models are based on, the better the model will perform. However, like with other models they are likely to be affected by batch effect-related differences between the data the model was trained on and the data that needs to be labeled. One of the advantages of these methods compared to models based on larger gene sets (see below) is that they are more transparent: we know on the basis of which genes the classification is done.<br>\n",

An alternative approach is to use a classifier that takes as input a larger set of genes (several thousands or more), thereby making more use of the breadth of scRNA-seq data. Such classifiers are trained on previously annotated datasets or atlases. Examples of these are CellTypist {cite}`anno:Conde2022` (see also https://www.celltypist.org, where data can be uploaded to a portal to get automated cell annotations) and Clustifyr {cite}`anno:Fu2020`.
