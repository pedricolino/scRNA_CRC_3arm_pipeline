    "To understand your data better and make use of existing knowledge, it is important to figure out the \"cellular identity\" of each of the cells in your data. The process of labeling groups of cells in your data based on known (or sometimes unknown) cellular phenotypes is called \"cell annotation\". Whereas there are many ways to annotate your cells (e.g. based on batch, disease, sex and more), in this notebook we will focus on the annotation of \"cell types\".<br>\n",
    "So what is a cell type? Biologists use the term cell type to denote a cellular phenotype that is robust across datasets, identifiable based on expression of specific markers (i.e. proteins or gene transcripts), and often linked to specific functions. For example, a plasma B cell is a type of white blood cell that secretes antibodies used to fight pathogens and it can be identified using specific markers. Knowing which cell types are in your sample is essential in understanding your data. For example, knowing that there are specific immune cell types in a tumor or unusual hematopoietic stem cells in your bone marrow sample can be a valuable insight into the disease you might be studying.<br>\n",
    "However, like with any categorization the size of categories and the borders drawn between them are partly subjective and can change over time, e.g. because new technologies allow for a higher resolution view of cells, or because specific \"sub-phenotypes\" that were not considered biologically meaningful are found to have important biological implications (see e.g. {cite}`anno:KadurLakshminarasimhaMurthy2022`). Cell types are therefore often further classified into \"subtypes\" or \"cell states\" (e.g. activated versus resting) and some researchers use the term \"cell identity\" to avoid this sometimes arbitrary distinction of cell types, cell subtypes and cell states. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, we recommend the review by Wagner et al. {cite}`anno:Wagner2016` and the recently published review by Zeng {cite}`anno:ZENG20222739`.<br>\n",
    "Similarly, multiple cell types can be part of a single continuum, where one cell type might transition or differentiate into another. For example, in hematopoiesis cells differentiate from a stem cell into a specific immune cell type. Although hard borders between early and late stages of this differentiation are often drawn, the state of these cells can more accurately be described by the differentiation coordinate between the less and more differentiated cellular phenotypes. We will discuss differentiation and cellular trajectories in subsequent chapters.<br>\n",
    "So how do we go about annotating cells in single-cell data? There are multiple ways to do it and we will give an overview of different approaches below. As we are working with transcriptomic data, each of these methods is ultimately based on the expression of specific genes or gene sets, or general transcriptomic similarity between cells. "

    "A final way to annotate your data is based on mapping your data to an existing, annotated single-cell reference and then performing label transfer using the resulting joint embedding. This reference can for example be a single sample that you annotated manually before, after which you would like to transfer those annotations to the rest of your dataset. Alternatively, it can be a published and ideally well-curated existing reference. In this context we refer to the \"new data\", i.e. the data to be mapped and annotated, as the \"query\".<br>\n",
    "There are multiple existing methods that perform such \"query-to-reference mapping\", including scArches {cite}`anno:Lotfollahi2022`, Symphony {cite}`anno:Kang2021`, and Azimuth (Seurat) {cite}`anno:HAO20213573`.

    "As query-to-reference mapping involves embedding new data into an __existing__ low-dimensional representation of the reference data, the dimensions and axes of that low-dimensional representation are largely pre-defined before learning from the query. Therefore, learning and incorporating unseen variation that might be present in the query (both new biological variation, e.g. unseen cell types or states and new technical variation, i.e. unseen batch effects that need to be removed) can be a challenge for these models. As a result, integration of the query data with the reference might not always be optimal and batch effects might not be fully removed from the joint query-reference embedding. However, as cell type label transfer does not necessarily require perfect integration but merely close proximity of identical cell types in the embedding, even an imperfect mapping can still be extremely helpful in annotating your data."

    "The uncertainty not only helps us identify regions where the algorithm is uncertain about which cell type a cell belongs to (e.g. because it falls in between two annotated phenotypes), but can also highlight unseen cell types or new cell states. For example, your reference might consist of healthy cells while your query could be from a diseased sample. The uncertainty score can then highlight disease-specific cell states, as they might not have neighbors from the reference that consistently come from a single cell type. Especially when your reference is based on a large set of datasets, the uncertainty score is useful to flag parts of the query data that could be interesting to look into. Reference-based label transfer thus not only helps you annotate your data, but can also speed up exploration and interpretation of your data. However, like any metric, these uncertainty scores are often not perfect and in some cases fail to highlight new cell types or states. For a more extensive discussion of uncertainty metrics, see e.g. {cite}`anno:Engelmann2019`."
